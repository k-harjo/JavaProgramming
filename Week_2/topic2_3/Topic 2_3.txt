2. The output displayed in the console shows the comparison and details of different instances of the `Person` class. The `==` operator compares object references, and in this case, it shows that `person1` and `person2` are not the same objects in memory. However, when using the `equals()` method, the comparison is based on the content of the objects, and thus it indicates that `person1` and `person2` are equal because their first and last names are the same. Similarly, since `person3` was created using the copy constructor with the same content as `person1`, the `equals()` method also shows that they are equal. The `toString()` method provides a formatted representation of the object details.

-The output displayed the results of comparing and printing instances of the `Person` class. The `equals()` method was overridden to compare the `firstName` and `lastName` attributes of two `Person` objects, leading to accurate equality checks. The `toString()` method was also overridden to provide a clear and concise representation of the `Person` object's information when printed. This allowed for proper comparison and printing of the `Person` objects in the `Test` class, resulting in the expected output.

-In a software project, the equals() method could be overridden to facilitate meaningful object comparisons, which is crucial for scenarios involving data integrity checks, duplicate detection, and searching operations. For instance, in an e-commerce application, the equals() method could be used to compare products based on their unique identifiers or attributes.
On the other hand, the toString() method, when overridden, helps in providing clear and human-readable representations of objects. This is particularly useful in debugging, logging, and displaying information to users. For instance, in a social networking application, the toString() method could be utilized to display user profiles with relevant details in a user-friendly manner.

-The `@Override` annotation in Java is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method in its superclass. Adding this annotation serves as a signal to the compiler and other developers that the method is intentionally designed to replace the implementation of a method from the parent class. It is good practice to use the `@Override` annotation because it helps prevent accidental mistakes, such as misspelling the method name or having the wrong method signature, which would result in the method not actually overriding the intended method. This annotation ensures that the method signature in the subclass matches the signature in the superclass, providing better clarity and catching potential errors at compile-time.
